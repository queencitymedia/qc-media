QC Media — Blocks 1–15 Verification (2025-09-07)

What this did:
- Ensured baseline Next.js files/folders exist
- Removed duplicate page.js (if present)
- Verified/seeded ops/data/offers.json
- Rewrote src/lib/offers.ts to use fileURLToPath + __dirname-relative DATA_FILE
- Ensured /api/offers and /api/offers/[id] route handlers and fixed bad import paths
- Enforced UTF-8 (no BOM) on all touched files
- Ensured package.json scripts: dev, clean
- Cleaned caches and launched dev server on a free port (3000–3010)
- Smoke-tested GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE on /api/offers
- Wrote report.json with step-by-step PASS/WARN/FAIL

Next handoff (to continue to Block 16+):
1) Keep the dev window open that this script launched.
2) Use the Block 16–30 script we’ll generate next (focus: Offers page UI polish, CSV import endpoint, and basic audit logging).
3) If anything above shows FAIL in report.json, send me that file and the terminal output.
